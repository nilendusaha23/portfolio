#Computer Vision Project
## Topic: Creating angle detection for an inverted pendulum using CV.

1. The project involves using novel CV based algorithms like Hough Transform, K-Means and etc.
2. The CV based algorithms mimic the functions of an anlge sensor, trying to measure the angle of an inverted pendulum.
3. Entire project is implemented in MATLAB and in Computer Vision toolbox.
4. This directory contains the working files and technical report for the project.
