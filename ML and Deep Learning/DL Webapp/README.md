This project was a part of my Assignment in Kingston University.
I was told to create a web app using Streamlit in Python.
The web app was supposed to perform defferent types of Deep Learning Operations.
Every point about this web app and the project is written in the given report.
Since the app resources are big in size, I have added a google drive link of the code.

Link for the CODE file:
