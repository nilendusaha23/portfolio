# Mechanism Design and Analysis using Siemens NX and MATLAB.
1. This is a part of my assignment in Kingston University.
2. In this project I had to perform kinematics and dynamics analysis of two-bar robotic arm and four-bar mechanism.
3. I had to compare between theoretical analysis and simulation based analysis.
4. Theoretical part was done on MATLAB.
5. Design and Simulation part was done on SIEMENS NX.
6. The project contains a technical report for better understanding.
